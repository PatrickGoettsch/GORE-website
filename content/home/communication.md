### Discord 

For fast communication during this event, the games and for direct communication of the participants with the responsible persons in the hosting arenas we use the vRoHOW Discord. There is already a good infrastructure available, and it will be extended by a separate area for the GORE. The necessary adjustments will be made in the near future. If you haven't joined, yet you can get an invitation link mailing the organisers.

### NextCloud

A NextCloud folder has been created where all important files can be stored as described in the rules. This can be found in the e-mail sent to your team.

### GameController
As a short info: The game controller has already been updated, thanks to Arne, and will be further adapted. The latest version can be found at the following address: [GitHub GameController](https://github.com/RoboCup-SPL/GameController)
